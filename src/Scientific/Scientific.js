                    More than 5,000 tons of extraterrestrial dust fall to Earth each year

                        Every year, our planet encounters dust from comets and asteroids. These interplanetary dust particles pass through our atmosphere and give rise to shooting stars. Some of them reach the ground in the form of micrometeorites. An international program conducted for nearly 20 years by scientists from the CNRS, the Université Paris-Saclay and the National museum of natural history with the support of the French polar institute, has determined that 5,200 tons per year of these micrometeorites reach the ground. The study will be available in the journal Earth & Planetary Science Letters from April 15.

                        Micrometeorites have always fallen on our planet. These interplanetary dust particles from comets or asteroids are particles of a few tenths to hundredths of a millimetre that have passed through the atmosphere and reached the Earth's surface.

                        To collect and analyse these micrometeorites, six expeditions led by CNRS researcher Jean Duprat have taken place over the last two decades near the Franco-Italian Concordia station (Dome C), which is located 1,100 kilometres off the coast of Adélie Land, in the heart of Antarctica. Dome C is an ideal collection spot due to the low accumulation rate of snow and the near absence of terrestrial dust.

                        These expeditions have collected enough extraterrestrial particles (ranging from 30 to 200 micrometres in size), to measure their annual flux, which corresponds to the mass accreted on Earth per square metre per year.

                        If these results are applied to the whole planet, the total annual flux of micrometeorites represents 5,200 tons per year. This is the main source of extraterrestrial matter on our planet, far ahead of larger objects such as meteorites, for which the flux is less than ten tons per year.

                        A comparison of the flux of micrometeorites with theoretical predictions confirms that most micrometeorites probably come from comets (80%) and the rest from asteroids.

                        This is valuable information to better understand the role played by these interplanetary dust particles in supplying water and carbonaceous molecules on the young Earth.

                        Notes

                        Comets are made of dust and ice. They come from far distances, from the Kuiper belt to the outer reaches of the Solar System. As they approach the Sun, comets become active through the sublimation of their ices and release cometary dust.
                        An asteroid is a mainly rocky celestial body of between a few hundred metres to several kilometres in size. The majority of these bodies are located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
                        This program has received funding from the IPEV, the CNRS, the CNES, the ANR, the Domaine d'intérêt majeur ACAV+, which supports research in the Ile-de-France region in the fields of astrophysics and the conditions of the appearance of life, as well as from LabEx P2IO. The French Polar Institute (IPEV) and its Italian counterpart (PNRA) provided the logistical support needed to carry out the field collection program.

                    Neanderthal ancestry identifies oldest modern human genome

                    In an article published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, an international team of researchers analyses the genome of an almost complete skull first discovered in Zlatý Kůň, Czechia in the early 1950s and now stored in the National Museum in Prague. The segments of Neanderthal DNA in its genome were longer than those of the Ust'-Ishim individual from Siberia, the previous oldest modern human sequenced, suggesting modern humans lived in the heart of Europe more than 45,000 years ago.

                    Ancient DNA from Neandertals and early modern humans has recently shown that the groups likely interbred somewhere in the Near East after modern humans left Africa some 50,000 years ago. As a result, all people outside Africa carry around 2% to 3% Neandertal DNA. In modern human genomes, those Neandertal DNA segments became increasingly shorter over time and their length can be used to estimate when an individual lived. Archaeological data published last year furthermore suggests that modern humans were already present in southeastern Europe 47-43,000 years ago, but due to a scarcity of fairly complete human fossils and the lack of genomic DNA, there is little understanding of who these early human colonists were -- or of their relationships to ancient and present-day human groups.

                    In a new study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, an international team of researchers reports what is likely the oldest reconstructed modern human genome to date. First discovered in Czechia, the woman known to researchers as Zlatý kůň (golden horse in Czech) displayed longer stretches of Neanderthal DNA than the 45,000-year-old Ust'-Ishim individual from Siberia, the so-far oldest modern human genome. Analysis suggests that she was part of a population that formed before the populations that gave rise to present-day Europeans and Asians split apart.

                    A recent anthropological study based on the shape of Zlatý kůň's skull showed similarities with people who lived in Europe before the Last Glacial Maximum -- at least 30,000 years ago -- but radiocarbon dating produced sporadic results, some as recent as 15,000 years ago. It wasn't until Jaroslav Brůžek from the Faculty of Science, Prague and Petr Velemínský of Prague's National Museum collaborated with the genetics laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History that a clearer picture came into view.

                    "We found evidence of cow DNA contamination in the analyzed bone, which suggests that a bovine-based glue used in the past to consolidate the skull was returning radiocarbon dates younger than the fossil's true age," says Cosimo Posth, co-lead author of the study. Posth was formerly a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and is currently Professor of Archaeo- and Palaeogenetics at the University of Tübingen.

                    However, it was the Neandertal DNA that led the team to their major conclusions about the age of the fossil. Zlatý kůň carried about the same amount Neanderthal DNA in her genome, as Ust Ishim or other modern humans outside Africa, but the segments with Neanderthal ancestry were on average much longer.

                    "The results of our DNA analysis show that Zlatý kůň lived closer in time to the admixture event with Neanderthals," says Kay Prüfer, co-lead author of the study.

                    The scientists were able to estimate that Zlatý kůň lived approximately 2,000 years after the last admixture. Based on these findings, the team argues that Zlatý kůň represents the oldest human genome to date, roughly the same age as -- if not a few hundred years older than -- Ust'-Ishim.

                    "It is quite intriguing that the earliest modern humans in Europe ultimately didn't succeed! Just as with Ust'-Ishim and the so far oldest European skull from Oase 1, Zlatý kůň shows no genetic continuity with modern humans that lived in Europe after 40,000 years ago," says Johannes Krause, senior author of the study and director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

                    One possible explanation for the discontinuity is the Campanian Ignimbrite volcanic eruption roughly 39,000 years ago, which severely affected climate in the northern hemisphere and may have reduced the survival chances of Neanderthals and early modern humans in large parts of Ice Age Europe.

                    As advances in ancient DNA reveal more about the story of our species, future genetic studies of other early European individuals will help to reconstruct the history and decline of the first modern humans to expand out of Africa and into Eurasia before the formation of modern-day non-African populations.

                    How humans develop larger brains than other apes  
                </h2>

                    A new study is the first to identify how human brains grow much larger, with three times as many neurons, compared with chimpanzee and gorilla brains. The study, led by researchers at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, identified a key molecular switch that can make ape brain organoids grow more like human organoids, and vice versa.

                    The study, published in the journal Cell, compared 'brain organoids' -- 3D tissues grown from stem cells which model early brain development -- that were grown from human, gorilla and chimpanzee stem cells.

                    Similar to actual brains, the human brain organoids grew a lot larger than the organoids from other apes.

                    Dr Madeline Lancaster, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who led the study, said: "This provides some of the first insight into what is different about the developing human brain that sets us apart from our closest living relatives, the other great apes. The most striking difference between us and other apes is just how incredibly big our brains are."

                    During the early stages of brain development, neurons are made by stem cells called neural progenitors. These progenitor cells initially have a cylindrical shape that makes it easy for them to split into identical daughter cells with the same shape.

                    The more times the neural progenitor cells multiply at this stage, the more neurons there will be later.

                    As the cells mature and slow their multiplication, they elongate, forming a shape like a stretched ice-cream cone.

                    Previously, research in mice had shown that their neural progenitor cells mature into a conical shape and slow their multiplication within hours.

                    Now, brain organoids have allowed researchers to uncover how this development happens in humans, gorillas and chimpanzees.

                    They found that in gorillas and chimpanzees this transition takes a long time, occurring over approximately five days.

                    Human progenitors were even more delayed in this transition, taking around seven days. The human progenitor cells maintained their cylinder-like shape for longer than other apes and during this time they split more frequently, producing more cells.

                    This difference in the speed of transition from neural progenitors to neurons means that the human cells have more time to multiply. This could be largely responsible for the approximately three-fold greater number of neurons in human brains compared with gorilla or chimpanzee brains.

                    Dr Lancaster said: "We have found that a delayed change in the shape of cells in the early brain is enough to change the course of development, helping determine the numbers of neurons that are made.

                    "It's remarkable that a relatively simple evolutionary change in cell shape could have major consequences in brain evolution. I feel like we've really learnt something fundamental about the questions I've been interested in for as long as I can remember -- what makes us human."

                    To uncover the genetic mechanism driving these differences, the researchers compared gene expression -- which genes are turned on and off -- in the human brain organoids versus the other apes.

                    They identified differences in a gene called 'ZEB2', which was turned on sooner in gorilla brain organoids than in the human organoids.

                    To test the effects of the gene in gorilla progenitor cells, they delayed the effects of ZEB2. This slowed the maturation of the progenitor cells, making the gorilla brain organoids develop more similarly to human -- slower and larger.

                    Conversely, turning on the ZEB2 gene sooner in human progenitor cells promoted premature transition in human organoids, so that they developed more like ape organoids.

                    The researchers note that organoids are a model and, like all models, do not to fully replicate real brains, especially mature brain function. But for fundamental questions about our evolution, these brain tissues in a dish provide an unprecedented view into key stages of brain development that would be impossible to study otherwise.

                    Dr Lancaster was part of the team that created the first brain organoids in 2013.

                    This study was funded by the Medical Research Council, European Research Council and Cancer Research UK.
