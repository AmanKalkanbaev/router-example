                    2022 Nissan GT-R NISMO Special Edition Looks Tough in Stealth Gray   
                </h2>

                    Nissan is building a limited number of this GT-R NISMO Special Edition for the United States, with orders opening in the fall.
                    The NISMO Special Edition is finished in Stealth Gray and features an exposed carbon-fiber hood and 20-inch wheels with red trim. It's also the first GT-R to wear Nissan's new logo.
                    This special GT-R has all-wheel drive and is powered by a 600-hp twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-6.
                    Nissan continues to tinker with the R35-generation GT-R even though it's getting close to retirement. This new GT-R NISMO Special Edition, which goes on sale in the U.S. this fall, will be extremely limited, though Nissan didn't share production numbers. And, no, it doesn't have any more power than the track-focused GT-R NISMO.
                    The special-edition cars get a blueprinted version—meaning it's built to tight specifications—of the NISMO's twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V-6, still equipped with the same turbochargers used on Nissan's GT-R GT3-class race car. It produces 600 horsepower and 481 pound-feet of torque (standard GT-Rs make 565 horsepower), sent to all four wheels through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. In our 2014 test of a GT-R NISMO, it launched to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds on its way to a 10.9-second quarter-mile at 128 mph.
                    GT-R NISMO (for Nissan Motorsport) cars are distinguished by a more aggressive aero kit with a large rear wing and red trim. The Special Edition cars are finished in a handsome exclusive Stealth Gray with an exposed carbon-fiber hood (non–Special Edition NISMOs also have carbon hoods). The cars also feature a set of 20-inch forged aluminum alloy wheels with a red rim and NISMO logo and are the first GT-Rs to wear the new Nissan logo, which is on the trunk and center caps. They also get a unique plaque with red script on their hand-built engines.
                    Nissan hasn't released pricing for the 2022 GT-R NISMO Special Edition, but we expect it to cost just over the standard NISMO's $212,535 starting price when orders open this fall.

                    Audi attacks EV mass market with Q4 e-tron

                    Audi is aiming at buyers in the upper end of the compact segment for full-electric vehicles with the Q4 e-tron unveiled Wednesday, while adding a key entry-level EV to the brand’s expanding lineup of battery-powered vehicles.

                    It’s the first Audi based on parent Volkswagen Group’s MEB electric-only platform that also underpins the VW ID3 compact hatchback and ID4 compact crossover.

                    The Q4 e-tron and the coupe-styled Q4 Sportback e-tron are built in VW’s plant in Zwickau, Germany, alongside the ID3 and ID4. Production started in March.

                    They have an 82-kilowatt-hour battery pack and two electric motors for a combined output of up to 295 hp and a range of up to 520 km (323 miles) under Europe's WLTP tests. The EVs will rival the Tesla Model Y as well as more mainstream electric crossovers such as Nissan’s forthcoming Ariya.

                    The Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron are expected to arrive in the U.S. toward the end of the year, Audi said in a statement. Pricing for the Q4 e-tron is planned to start under $45,000.
                    The Q4 e-tron is 4590 mm (15 feet) long, slightly longer than the ID4, which is 4580 mm, but shorter than the Skoda Enyaq, also an MEB-based electric crossover, which is 4650 mm in length.

                    With their long wheelbases and short overhangs, the cabin space is similar in size to a large utility vehicle, Audi said. The more practical of the two, the Q4 e-tron, has a 520-liter trunk. Luggage space rises to 1,490 liters with the rear seats folded flat.

                    The design of both models is characterized by a prominent grille, big wheels and defined wheel arches. The styling gives each body a more sculptured look than the ID3 and ID4.

                    The Q4 e-tron models include the option of an augmented-reality head-up display. The same system is also available on the ID3 and ID4 and superimposes turn signals on the road ahead, which Audi says helps while driving in poor visibility.

                    The head-up display also helps with the adaptive cruise control assistance, which keeps the car centered in its lane. If the car approaches a lane marking without the turn signal having been activated, the lane departure warning display projected on the windshield superimposes a red line on the real-life lane marking.

                    Ford Mustang Mach-E, F-150 to Get ‘BlueCruise’ Later this Year  
                </h2>

                    UPDATE 4/14/2021: Ford has announced that its forthcoming hands-free driving tech—formerly referred to as Active Drive Assist—will be called BlueCruise. The Ford Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 will be the first Ford vehicles with BlueCruise, and it'll become available through an over-the-air update in the third quarter of this year. Not all 2021 Mach-Es and F-150s will be eligible; only those with the hardware which comes in the Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package will be able to run BlueCruise. The hands-free driver assist system intended to be an alternative to Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise can be used on over 100,000 miles of divided highways in North America.
                    As driver-assist systems have progressed in recent years, the ability to go hands-free—albeit in select environments—has become a telling marker of how advanced any system is. Ford announced that in the coming year, it will add itself to the list of automakers claiming hands-free systems with the advancement of its Co-Pilot360 technology.
                    There are also improvements in the package to the vehicle's adaptive cruise control to include lane centering and the ability to stay engaged in stop-and-go traffic. Co-Pilot360 will also have a driver-facing camera that tracks the eyes and head position of the driver ensuring they are paying attention while hands-free or are using the hands-on lane-centering system. In March, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) issued a recommendation that the advanced driver-assist systems with hands-free capability should monitor drivers to require them to pay attention.

                <h2>
                    2022 Mazda MX-30 EV Coming to California This Fall, Hybrid to Follow

                </h2>

                    <img alt={"jpg"}  src={Mazda}/>
                    Mazda's first electric vehicle will finally arrive in the United States later this year, starting in California this fall. The 2022 MX-30 will initially be available only as a battery-powered EV, while a plug-in-hybrid version with a rotary gasoline engine will arrive later on, likely sometime next year.

                    The fully electric version features a single electric motor powering the front wheels. Power output is 144 horsepower and 200 pound-feet of torque, making it significantly less powerful than many other affordable EVs.
                    A small lithium-ion battery pack provides just 35.5 kWh of total capacity—Mazda isn't providing a usable-capacity number yet, but we'd estimate it at around 32.0 kWh. This means that the MX-30 isn't likely to offer much more than 100 miles of range on a single charge on the EPA cycle. (Official ratings aren't yet available, but the MX-30 is rated at 124 miles on the more optimistic WLTP cycle.) Mazda hasn't released specs for the range-extender hybrid version, but its gasoline engine and fuel tank will likely provide significantly more driving range. DC fast-charging capability is standard, with Mazda claiming that the MX-30 can charge to 80 percent full in 36 minutes.
                    Within the current context of EV offerings, the MX-30 is more of a competitor to the Mini Electric, which has similar power and range numbers, than it is an alternative to longer-range affordable options such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV. And like the Mini, the MX-30 has distinctive styling inside and out, with RX-8–inspired rear half doors and interesting materials such as cork found on the dashboard.

                    While pricing is not yet available, we think the MX-30 will need an appealingly low starting price to overcome its low range and power numbers. The Mini Electric starts at just over $30,000, so Mazda would do well to try to match or undercut that with the MX-30's base price.
