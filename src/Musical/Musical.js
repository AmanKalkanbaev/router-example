                    A collection of David Bowie’s non-album singles, alternate versions and BBC In Concert sessions will be packaged for a new compilation, ‘The Width of a Circle’.

                    The compilation will mostly comprise recordings from a session with John Peel in 1970, in which Bowie performed alongside The Tony Visconti Trio, otherwise known as ‘The Hype’.

                    Also among the collection is the five-song score Bowie composed for the BBC drama The Looking Glass Murders (aka Pierrot in Turquoise), and four songs recorded for the Andy Ferris Show in the ’70s, including a cover of the Velvet Underground’s ‘Waiting For The Man’ and the compilation’s title track.
                    Elsewhere, the two-CD set will include 2020 mixes of ‘The Prettiest Star’, ‘London Bye, Ta-Ta’, ‘Memory Of A Free Festival’, ‘All The Madmen’ and ‘Holy Holy’, produced by Visconti.

                    ‘The Width of a Circle’ will be released on May 28, and is available to pre-order now.
                    ‘The Width of a Circle’ is being marketed as a companion piece to the re-release of Bowie’s third studio album, ‘The Man Who Sold The World’. The album was recently re-released under the title ‘Metrobolist’, which was Bowie’s intended name for the LP, but was changed by his label without consultation.

                    The ‘WAP’ rapper’s collaboration with the sportswear company, dubbed the Summertime Fine Collection, is due to launch next Friday (April 23) and includes athleisurewear and accessories for women and children.

                    Among the items is a cropped sweatshirt, high-rise leggings, a two-in-one bodysuit, and sneakers in monochromatic colours. Also featured in the collection are Men’s Club C shoes, which are available in three colours, as well as the Slip-On III style for boys (in Crisp Purple and Vector Red).
                    Speaking to Rolling Stone about the venture, Cardi explained: “I’m so happy to be releasing my first collection with Reebok. I drew a lot of my inspiration from growing up in New York in the ’90s – I used those moments as inspiration to make beautiful clothes for women today.”
                    The rapper also highlighted the importance of creating size-inclusive items, with each piece of the spring/summer 2021 line being offered in sizes 2XS-4X. “This collection gives every woman the product they need to feel sexy and confident,” Cardi said.

                    Last week Cardi B explained that she was planning to “go away for a very long time” in order to complete work on her new album, the anticipated follow-up to her 2018 debut ‘Invasion Of Privacy’.

                    “Last year I was like, ‘I gotta put out my album this year,’” she said. “But, then I just stopped working on my album out of nowhere because I feel like the whole COVID thing discouraged me to put out my album. Because I want to put out an album, and I want to tour.”

                    Twenty One Pilots have shared a behind-the-scenes look at the making of their new video for ‘Shy Away’ – watch below.

                    The Big Read: Twenty One Pilots: “We want to be the best – and keep everyone else at bay”
                    The track was released last week as the lead single from the Ohio duo’s forthcoming sixth album ‘Scaled And Icy’, which is due for release on May 21 via Fueled By Ramen.

                    Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun shared a clip titled ‘Shy Away (Beyond the Video)’ on their YouTube channel. It offers fans a glimpse of how they made the song’s colourful official visuals, which were directed by Miles Cable and AJ Favicchio.
                    The eight-minute clip sees the duo shoot the performance scenes on set, with the aforementioned directors and crew appearing masked in line with COVID-19 restrictions. Viewers are later talked through various camera angles and scene set-ups.
                    “Some people probably feel like our job’s pretty easy but it’s really hard,” the band joke at one point, adding that the process of shooting a video “is easily the hardest part of what we do”.
                    Joseph goes on to speak down a fake public telephone. “Sorry, do you have a microphone that works?” he says. “We’ve been happy to just pretend for this whole video shoot, and I think it’s because the microphone is just on a cable that goes nowhere.”

                    ‘Scaled And Icy’ was written and largely produced by Joseph over the course of the past year at his home studio while he was in isolation, with Dun engineering the drums remotely from across the country.

                <h2>
                    Rapper DMX dead at 50

                </h2>

                    "Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end. He loved his family with all of his heart, and we cherish the times we spent with him," the family said, adding that his music "inspired countless fans across the world."

                    Memorial plans were not yet set.

                    DMX - who rapped with a trademark raspy delivery that was often paired with growls, barks and "What!" as an ad-lib - built a multiplatinum career in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but he also struggled with drug addiction and legal problems that repeatedly put him behind bars.

                    "His message of triumph over struggle, his search for the light out of darkness, his pursuit of truth and grace brought us closer to our own humanity," his record label, Def Jam Recordings, said in a statement describing him as "nothing less than a giant."

                    Fellow hip hop artists remembered him likewise, with Eve praising him as "one of the most special people I have ever met" and Nas calling him "Gods poet" in an Instagram post.

                    DMX made a splash in 1998 with his first studio album, "It's Dark and Hell is Hot," which debuted No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The multiplatinum-selling album was anchored by several hits including "Ruff Ryders' Anthem," "Get At Me Dog," "Stop Being Greedy" and "How It's Goin' Down."

                    DMX followed up with four straight chart-topping albums including "... And Then There Was X," "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood," "The Great Depression" and "Grand Champ." He released seven albums, earned three Grammy nominations and was named favorite rap/hip-hop artist at the 2000 American Music Awards.

                    DMX arrived on the rap scene around the same time as Jay-Z, Ja Rule and others who dominated the charts and emerged as platinum-selling acts. They were all part of rap crews, too: DMX fronted the Ruff Ryders collective, which helped launch the careers of Grammy winners Eve and Swizz Beatz, and relaunch The Lox, formerly signed to Bad Boy Records. Ruff Ryders had success on the charts and on radio with its "Ryde or Die" compilation albums.

                    Along with his musical career, DMX paved his way as an actor. He starred in the 1998 film "Belly" and appeared in 2000's "Romeo Must Die" with Jet Li and Aaliyah. DMX and Aaliyah teamed up for "Come Back in One Piece" on the film's soundtrack.

                    The rapper would later open Aaliyah's tribute music video, "Miss You," alongside her other friends and collaborators, including Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim and Queen Latifah, after Aaliyah's 2001 death in a plane crash at age 22.

                    The rapper also starred in 2001s "Exit Wounds" with Steven Seagal and 2003s "Cradle 2 the Grave" with Li.

                    But while DMX made his mark as one of hip-hop's most recognizable names for his rap artistry and as an actor, the rapper was personally stifled by his legal battles - he was repeatedly arrested and jailed within a decade - and drug addiction. His addiction first took hold at age 14 when smoked a marijuana cigarette that was laced with cocaine.

                    "Earl Simmons was a wonderful, caring father, and a sensitive, thoughtful man," said Lyor Cohen, a former executive at Def Jam, in a statement. "Unfortunately, Dark Man X took over and ran amok, tormented and struggling to find the light. ... DMX gave me the inspiration to keep going at Def Jam when rap became soft and silly."

                    DMX pleaded guilty in 2004 after he posed as an undercover federal agent and crashed his SUV through a security gate at New York's Kennedy Airport. He was arrested in 2008 on drug and animal cruelty charges following an overnight raid on his house in Phoenix. He tried to barricade himself in his bedroom but emerged when a SWAT team entered his home.

                    In 2010, he was sentenced to a year in prison for violating terms of his probation. After he was admitted to rehab numerous times over the next year, he said he had finally beat his drug addiction.

                    First responders helped bring DMX back to life after he was found in a hotel parking lot in New York in 2016. The rapper said he suffered from asthma.

                    A couple years later, DMX was sentenced to a year in prison for tax fraud. Prosecutors said he concocted a multiyear scheme to hide millions of dollars in income from the IRS and get around nearly $2 million in tax liabilities.

                    After his release, DMX planned a 32-date tour to mark the 20th anniversary of "It's Dark and Hell is Hot." But the rapper canceled a series of shows to check himself into a rehab facility in 2019. In an Instagram post, his team said he apologized for the canceled shows and thanked his fans for the continued support.

                    Besides his legal troubles, DMX took the initiative to help the less fortunate. He gave a group of Philadelphia men advice during a surprise appearance at a homeless support group meeting in 2017, and helped a Maine family with its back-to-school purchases a couple years later.

                    Last year, DMX faced off against Snoop Dogg in a Verzuz battle, which drew more than 500,000 viewers.

                    "You can't be a fan and not feel empathy for him in his journey," hip-hop and electronic music producer Flying Lotus said in an interview while DMX was hospitalized this week. "You think of 'Belly' and all the great stuff that he was part of. But he was dealt such a weird hand, I think, with the drug stuff. And I just have empathy."

                    Survivors include his 15 children and his mother.
